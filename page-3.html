            <p>A voice in the distance is calling for you. You do not recognise it and starting to wonder who it is and what it is saying.<br />
                The voice it getting clearer and clearer and you can hear it is repeating the same sentence over and over again:<br />
                <em>"You need me, you want me, I can make you the legend you want to be, become a rock star with my help. <br />
                    (shouting)<strong>COME FIND ME!"</strong>"</em></p>
